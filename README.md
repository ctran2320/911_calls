# 911 Calls for Montgomery County, Pennsylvania
## Topic:
We will be looking at emergency 911 calls in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.
## Audience:
For our data visualization, our audiences will be for the Montgomery County Health
Department as well as for police departments and hospitals. Through the data
visualization, if we can show what emergencies occur most often at a certain time (hour
of the day, month), the health department can issue public warnings to help mitigate
these issues.
## Data sources:
Our data set will be from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/mchirico/montcoalert. It has 9
columns and 663,253 rows. The dataset contains information on emergency 911 calls
from 2015-2020. Information this data set contains is: latitude and longitude
coordinates, description of the emergency, zip code, title of emergency, date and time
of the call, township, and the general address.
## Possible risks:
A possible risk is that a correlation between 2 variables may exist but would not imply
causation. Therefore, the data visualization would be presenting misinformation.
Audience may not understand our graphs.
## Form:
We will make a presentation to portray our charts. We feel like this is an effective
approach because we are simulating a scenario where we are presenting to the
countyâ€™s city officials. Through a presentation, we can discuss from beginning to end the
process of creating our charts and the message those charts tell and how it impacts the
county.
## Tools/tech:
To create our charts, we will use Tableau, Javascript and various libraries (D3,
highcharts, zingcharts, etc), powerpoint, and Python for the actual data wrangling, etc.
